# INFERENCE SECTION: Configuration for GUI Agents (used by test_loop_*.py)
# ============================================================================
# These settings configure the core model for GUI Agents (AppAgent,
# TARS15Agent, UITarsAgent). GUI Agents use specialized fine-tuned models
# that directly generate GUI actions from screenshots and task instructions.
# This is different from MobileAgent which uses multiple models for different
# reasoning steps. GUI Agents use a single model for end-to-end action generation.
